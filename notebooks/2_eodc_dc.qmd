In this notebook we showcase openEO's standardization of remote sensing and Earth observation operations. We do this by translating the flood mapping algorithm as presented in @bauer-marschallinger_satellite-based_2022 to the openEO syntax of the Python Client. This algorithm employs Sentinel-1 backscattered microwaves, so-called "sigma nought" or $\sigma^0$, to detect flooding. In this exercise we will replicate the case study of the above mentioned paper, the February 2018 flooding of the Greek region of Thessaly.

## Setting-up a Python session

We begin by loading openEO and some additional packages. In this exercise we make use of a local variant of openEO as the data is not yet available on an accessible data store.

```{python}
# from datetime import datetime
# from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np

import xarray as xr
import rioxarray
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import cartopy.io.img_tiles as cimgt

import openeo
```

## Connect to the EODC openEO back-end

Establish a connection to the EODC backend with `openeo.connect()`. This results in a connection object which is a critical aspect of collection discovery on the back-end by openEO. 

```{python}
backend = "https://openeo.eodc.eu" 
connection = openeo.connect(backend)
connection.authenticate_oidc()
```


## Load collections

We can then load the collections. This is done by using the method `load_collection()` and by using the collection ids as defined above.

```{python}

spatial_extent = {"west": 22, "south": 39.483774, "east": 22.225465, "north": 39.6}
sensing_date = ["2018-02-28T04:00:00Z", "2018-02-28T05:00:00Z"]
sig0_dc = connection.load_collection(
    "SENTINEL1_SIG0_20M",
    spatial_extent = spatial_extent,
    temporal_extent = sensing_date,
    bands=["VV"]
)
hparam_dc = connection.load_collection(
    "SENTINEL1_HPAR",
    spatial_extent = spatial_extent,
    temporal_extent = "2019"
)
plia_dc = connection.load_collection(
    "SENTINEL1_MPLIA",
    spatial_extent = spatial_extent,
    temporal_extent = ["2020-01-01", "2020-12-31"]
)

sig0_res = sig0_dc.save_result(format = "NetCDF")
sig0_job = sig0_res.create_job(title = "sig0_greece_flood_2018_as_NetCDF_py")
hparam_res = hparam_dc.save_result(format = "NetCDF")
hparam_job = hparam_res.create_job(title = "hparam_greece_flood_2018_as_NetCDF_py")
plia_res = plia_dc.save_result(format = "NetCDF")
plia_job = plia_res.create_job(title = "plia_greece_flood_2018_as_NetCDF_py")
```


```{python}
sig0_dc = xr.open_mfdataset("openEO_eodc/*.nc", concat_dim="time", combine='nested')
sig0_dc.where(sig0_dc != -9999). \
    mean(dim="time"). \
    to_array(). \
    plot(x="x", y="y", vmin=-230, vmax=-110)
```

```{python}
hparam_dc = xr.open_dataset("")
hparam_dc
```

```{python}
hplia_dc = xr.open_dataset("")
plia_dc
```
