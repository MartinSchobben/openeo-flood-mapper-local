	abstract = {Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are well-established systems for flood mapping, thanks to their high sensitivity towards water surfaces and their independence from daylight and cloud cover. Particularly able is the 2014-launched Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR mission, with its systematic monitoring schedule featuring global land coverage in a short revisit time and a 20 m ground resolution. Yet, variable environment conditions, low-contrasting land cover, and complex terrain pose major challenges to fully automated flood monitoring. To overcome these issues, and aiming for a robust classification, we formulate a datacube-based flood mapping algorithm that exploits the Sentinel-1 orbit repetition and a priori generated probability parameters for flood and non-flood conditions. A globally applicable flood signature is obtained from manually collected wind- and frost-free images. Through harmonic analysis of each pixel’s full time series, we derive a local seasonal non-flood signal comprising the expected backscatter values for each day-of-year. From those predefined probability distributions, we classify incoming Sentinel-1 images by simple Bayes inference, which is computationally slim and hence suitable for near-real-time operations, and also yields uncertainty values. The datacube-based masking of no-sensitivity resulting from impeding land cover and ill-posed SAR configuration enhances the classification robustness. We employed the algorithm on a 6-year Sentinel-1 datacube over Greece, where a major flood hit the region of Thessaly in 2018. In-depth analysis of model parameters and sensitivity, and the evaluation against microwave and optical reference flood maps, suggest excellent flood mapping skill, and very satisfying classification metrics with about 96\% overall accuracy and only few false positives. The presented algorithm is part of the ensemble flood mapping product of the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) component of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).},

	abstract = {Upcoming remote sensing systems onboard satellites will generate unprecedented volumes of spatial data, hence challenging processing facilities in terms of storage and processing capacities. Thus, an efficient handling of remote sensing data is of vital importance, demanding a well-suited definition of spatial grids for the data׳s storage and manipulation. For high-resolution image data, regular grids defined by map projections have been identified as practicable, cognisant of their drawbacks due to geometric distortions. To this end, we defined a new metric named grid oversampling factor (GOF) that estimates local data oversampling appearing during projection of generic satellite images to a regular raster grid. Based on common map projections, we defined sets of spatial grids optimised to minimise data oversampling. Moreover, they ensure that data undersampling cannot occur at any location. From the resulting GOF-values we concluded that equidistant projections are most suitable, with a global mean oversampling of 2\% when using a system of seven continental grids (introduced under the name Equi7 Grid). Opposed to previous studies that suggested equal-area projections, we recommend the Plate Carrée, the Equidistant Conic and the Equidistant Azimuthal projection for global, hemispherical and continental grids, respectively.},
