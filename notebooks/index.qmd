# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a interTwin thematic module example. 

In this notebook we showcase openEOs standardization of remote sensing and Earth observation operations. We do this by translating the flood mapping algorithm as presented in @bauer-marschallinger_satellite-based_2022 to the openEO syntax of the Python Client. This algorithm employs Sentinel-1 backscattered microwaves, so-called "sigma nought" or $\sigma^0$, to detect flooding. In this exercise we will replicate the case study of the above mentioned paper, the February 2018 flooding of the Greek region of Thessaly.
